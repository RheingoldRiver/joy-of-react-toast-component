# Toast Component (Joy of React course, project 2)
## Milestones completed

* Project requirements (see [self evaluation](https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/joy-of-react-toast-component/pull/6))
* Converted CSS to tailwind (where appropriate - animations are left as they were originally).
* Added a `title` field.
* Added a `Ctrl+Enter` hotkey to send the form from any field.
* Added a `seconds` parameter to specify a timeout, including a note that this is against accessibility guidelines.
